An introduction to American FX basket options hedging: an application to a eur-denominated usd and cnh basket during flight to quality times
Basket options play a relevant role in corporate finance since they allow a more
bona fide hedging, allowing to trade the correlation between a couple of assets. Basket options are,
in general, index options or currency options: the elephant in the room is the correlation between the
assets. In the first pages of this essay, we prove that if the two underlings' assets are correlated,
adequate gamma-delta hedging could be reached only using basket options. The standard multimarket
model seems to apply not enough. We are interested in the option's price and recovering the main
hedging parameters (the single-asset gammas and the cross gamma) and their sensitivity to the interest
rate and time. We are highly interested in the cross gamma since the gamma is the only Greek where
the European greek is not a good proxy of the American one. The gamma of the early exercise
premium plays a significant role in the hedging strategy. That is why, simili modo, we cannot rely on
previous studies on European contracts, which are unsatisfactory. Results seem relevant enough and
suggest further research to be conducted. We refer to American options, though some considerations
concerning the pricing scheme interest even the European contracts. The main results concern the
inapplicability of a pure first-order hedging strategy.
In contrast, a second-order hedging strategy seems more suitable to be implemented, accounting even
for the correlation between the two underlying thanks to the cross gamma. This requires, however,
an adequate estimation of the second-order hedging parameters. In addition, even if there is no explicit
comparison robustness of the results confirms the actuality of the scientific interest in the LongstaffSchwarz approximation.
